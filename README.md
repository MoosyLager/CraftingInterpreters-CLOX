# Crafting Interpreters Part Two - clox

## Author

Shenal Herath

## Description

This is the second part of the book designing another interpreter, _clox_, written in C to implement the _lox_ language.

This is my implementation after following the [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Robert Nystrom.
